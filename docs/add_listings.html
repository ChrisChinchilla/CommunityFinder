Anyone in the community can add listings to the network straight away. You can also sign up to the site, and become a contributor, allowing you add listings that you can control and manage, as well as having access to extra features.

Anonymous Listings can be added by anyone, and can be edited by anyone, but can only be removed by contributors. They can also be 'claimed' by contributors, such as in the case when an organisation wants to manage an anonymous listing added about them.

'Owned' Listings are added by contributors, and can only be edited by the user who added them.

Adding Listings on Behalf of other groups or individuals

When adding a listing, tick the 'added on behalf of another group' check box and then provide appropriate contact information:

Email Address: When a email address is provided, users who click the 'contact' link are able to send an email to that address.

Contact Form URL: When a URL is provided, users who click the 'contact' link will be redirected to that address in a new new browser tab.

Other contact information: When other contact information is provided, users who click the 'contact' link will be provided with this additional information.

Passing Control of a listings added on behalf of other groups or individuals

If you've added a listing on behalf of another group or individual, and if they at some point join the network, you can pass control of that listing to them, allowing their listing to be maintained by them, ensuring the most appropriate up to date informaiton is provided.

Currently not working, contact email address xxx to do this.

Note: If you have a customised map embeded into your website that only displays listings owned by you, you can still displaty listings that you have passed to other members, by adding these listings to your 'watch list'. See website plugin page for more details...
