<h2>Welcome to VictoriaMyCommunity.org</h2>
<p>VictoriaMyCommunity.org is a collaborative, locality based, community network, that allows you to connect with 
services, resources and groups in your community. The site uses a locality based interface that makes it easy to see 
whats happening in your area. Find resources, community groups, services, and events, discuss and rate information 
others have added, or add information about your community that others would find useful.<br/>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Search, Browse and Find information about your community</b><br/>
Once you've zoomed the map in to the area your interested in, use the search bar to filter and find specific information 
in that area, just start typing in the search bar and we'll suggest information that matches  what you've typed.  Or just browse 
through listings by clicking on them on the map.</p>

<p><b>Explore and Connect with the Information you find</b><br/>
Once you've found a resource that you're interested in, there are a number of ways you can find out and connect to more information about
that resource
<ul>
<li>Find out general information about a listing including its address and phone details</li>
<li>Preview and link through to associated websites</li>
<li>Link through to associated Wikipedia articles </li>
<li>Read and Bookmark groups twitter, news and blog feeds</.li>
<li>Add Comments to the listing to provide more information for others to read</.li>
<li>Share Information with friends on Facebook and Twitter</.li>
<li>Contact the user or group that the listing is about, and find information about the user or group that added the listing to the network</.li>
</ul>

<p><b>Add Information about your community:</b><br/>
And if you know of a resource in your area that isn't 'on the map', you can add a listing about that resources  yourself, 
by simply entering an address or by clicking on the map where you want the listing to appear, even add 
listings about groups you know, then invite them to manage their listing, or sign up yourself so you can track and 
manage your own listings in your inbox.  Learn more about adding listings...<br/>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Other Features</b></p>

<p><b>Website Plugin</b<br>
Use the plugin tool to customise the network for your website.  Only display the information about the resources your interested
in, in your area, even only display the listings  that your group has added.  In this way you can use the system to 'map out' the 
resources in your community that your group is interested in, while allowing that information to be displayed on the main site,
and other sites wanting to display that information.</p>
