I'm not sure how many of you have experience in the ngo/government/community sector(s), but it's a sector that loves to map things.

Mapping resources, services, projects and more, maps are a great way of visualising a community and also as a lobbying tool as pollies you're trying to convince can see what you're trying to express in relation to their electorate.

Personally I've seen many organisations and projects who want to map their community and despite my encouragement that they all collaborate to create a larger, consolidated and filterable map, they all still go off and create their own maps, that invariably run out of steam or get forgotten about.

Recently I finally met some individuals who shared my vision of creating a mapping tool that can easily store many sets of community information, allowing for easy adding of listings manually, or by bulk imports from a variety of other mapping data sources. conversely, also allowing for easy export of listings into other systems for visualisation or manipulation.

A tool that is easy to use and can be utilised as a repository of mapping information, a fantatsic reosurce in itself, but also ideal for any other organisation who wants to create a map for their own purposes to store informationa and extract for their needs.

As luck would have it, I knew someone who had such a tool and had had it for several years, so they were bought into the mix, here's the current versionâ€¦

www.victoriamycommunity.org (Domain will change soon)

We're ironng out a few things with the online version, but in readiness for a launch early in 2013 we're keen to create a mobile version to and here's where you come in!

This is a working bee to create a mobile 'app' of the site, we're planning a multiplatform web app style implementation, then probably wrapped in PhoneGap or left as a common mobile optimised website.

So, people with JavaScript and mobile development experience are more than welcome, as are those with PHP, responsive design skills, iOS design skills, Android design skills. Testers, UX experts and those with general interest in mapping are also more than welcome to lend their expertise.

So join us in helping help many organisations and individuals who are keen to grow their communities.
